# Introduction to WebAssembly

A hacked together introduction to WASM concepts and programming

The last comment block of each slide will be treated as slide notes. It will be visible and editable in Presenter Mode along with the slide. [Read more in the docs](https://sli.dev/guide/syntax.html#notes)

# Origins of WebAssembly (WASM)

- First appeared 2017
- First release 2019

According to the WebAssembly specification:

> ... Its main goal is to enable high performance **applications on the Web,**

but then also

> ... but it does not make any Web-specific assumptions or provide Web-specific
> features, so it can be employed in **other environments** as well.

# Example with Emscripten/C (1)

For this example, a very simple C function was compiled to WASM using the 
Emscripten SDK. The code is very simple:

```c
#include <emscripten.h>

EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE
int my_add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

This code almost looks like regular C with the exception of the 
`EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE` macro and the special `#include`.

---

# Example with Emscripten/C (2)

To get this example built, the command line looks almost identical to calling another C/C++
compiler, like `gcc` or `clang`:

```bash
emcc 02_intro.c -o build/02_intro.js
```

The actual call has a couple of additional parameters that are needed, to make sure that the
single function in our `.c` file is not optimized away and that we also get the JS-function
`cwrap` which we need to create a wrapper around the C-function for easier use with Javascript.

---

# Example with Emscripten/C (3)

Notice that we ask `emcc` to generate a JS source file (`-o build/02_intro.js`). Emscripten however
will also generate the `.wasm` file. The JS file contains helper functions to simplify the
interaction between Javascript and the C/C++\-based WASM module. More of that will be explained
later.

# Example with Emscripten/C (4)

Now we just need to include this in our website

```html
<script src="build/02_intro.js"></script>
```

... load the WASM module from Javascript ...

```javascript
Module.onRuntimeInitialized = _ => {
  my_add = Module.cwrap('my_add', 'number',
                        ['number', 'number']);
}
```

... and then just call it as a Javascript function

```javascript
let result = my_add(100, 20);
```

# Complex Emscripten example

# Basic concepts

At the very bottom, WebAssembly defines a very simple **Virtual Machine**. 

* Stack-based instruction set (i32/i64, f32/f64)
* Linear memory
    * single, 32-bit memory space 
        * proposal for up to 64 bit
        * proposal for multiple memories
* Interface defined through WASM modules
    * function signature types
    * imports and exports
    * global variables
    * tables

---

# WASM == JVM++? Or JVM-\-? ðŸ˜œ

| | **WASM** | **JVM** |
|-|------|-----|
| **Instructions** | ALU, control flow, memory access, table operations | ALU, control flow, object access and manipulation, special calls |
| **Data types** | `i32`, `i64`, `f32`, `f64`, `v128`, func references, extern opaque references | integer, long, short, byte, char, float, double, object references |
| **Interfacing** | Module, globals, memory imports/exports | JVM builtins, JNI |

# Baremetal WebAssembly Example

For a better understanding of what actually happens under the hood, it is helpful to look at an
example in "plain webassembly". Using the ****wabt** toolchain we can also write WASM modules using
a textual representation of the WebAssembly "assembler language" that is structured like Lisp
programms.

<!-- I'm just cheating a little here, this is actually WAT-code, but Shiki has no formatter
for this. So we just use clojure that also uses s-expressions -->
```clojure
(module
  (func (export "wat_add") (param i32 i32) (result i32)
    local.get 0
    local.get 1
    i32.add))
```

# Languages compiling to WASM

A growing list of languages provides WASM targets:

stable(?):

- [C++ Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/index.html), [Rust](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/)
- [TinyGo, a Go variant](https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo) targetting a wide range of embedded devices, desktop OSes and WASM
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#WebAssembly) targetting various freestanding and OS-based targets as well as WASM
- C#, Python, Swift, TypeScript, Scala, Kotlin, ... (see some details in the [Fermyon project](https://developer.fermyon.com/wasm-languages/webassembly-language-support))

in development:
- [Grain](https://grain-lang.org/)
- [Virgil](https://github.com/titzer/virgil) targetting X86 MacOS, Linux, JAR files and WASM
- [MoonBit](https://www.moonbitlang.com/)

# Components

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly. And adding your custom components is also super easy.

```html
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

Check out [the guides](https://sli.dev/builtin/components.html) for more.

# Themes

Slidev comes with powerful theming support. Themes can provide styles, layouts, components, or even configurations for tools. Switching between themes by just **one edit** in your frontmatter:

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">

```yaml
---
theme: default
---
```

```yaml
---
theme: seriph
---
```

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-default/01.png?raw=true" alt="">

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-seriph/01.png?raw=true" alt="">

# Clicks Animations

You can add `v-click` to elements to add a click animation.

<div v-click>

This shows up when you click the slide:

```html
<div v-click>This shows up when you click the slide.</div>
```

</div>

<br>

<v-click>

The <span v-mark.red="3"><code>v-mark</code> directive</span>
also allows you to add
<span v-mark.circle.orange="4">inline marks</span>
, powered by [Rough Notation](https://roughnotation.com/):

```html
<span v-mark.underline.orange>inline markers</span>
```

</v-click>

<div mt-20 v-click>

# Monaco Editor

Slidev provides built-in Monaco Editor support.

Add `{monaco}` to the code block to turn it into an editor:

```ts {monaco}
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { emptyArray } from './external'

const arr = ref(emptyArray(10))
```

Use `{monaco-run}` to create an editor that can execute the code directly in the slide:

```ts {monaco-run}
import { version } from 'vue'
import { emptyArray, sayHello } from './external'

sayHello()
console.log(`vue ${version}`)
console.log(emptyArray<number>(10).reduce(fib => [...fib, fib.at(-1)! + fib.at(-2)!], [1, 1]))
```
